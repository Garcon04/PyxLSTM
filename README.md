# PyxLSTM
PyxLSTM is a Python library that provides an efficient and extensible implementation of the Extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) architecture. xLSTM enhances the traditional LSTM by introducing exponential gating, memory mixing, and a matrix memory structure, enabling improved performance and scalability for sequence modeling tasks.
